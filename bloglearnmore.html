            <img src="techimg/web2.jpg" alt="Web Development Evolution" class="article-image">
            <p>Web development has come a long way since its inception in the early 90s. Starting from simple static pages using HTML, we've now evolved into dynamic, interactive web applications powered by JavaScript, CSS frameworks, and advanced backend technologies.</p>
            <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the building block of web pages. The journey began with HTML 1.0, and over the years, it has evolved to HTML5, which supports modern features such as multimedia integration, local storage, and responsive design capabilities.</p>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) also played a pivotal role in enhancing the visual aesthetics of web pages. From inline styles to modern-day frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, web designers now have more power and flexibility to create visually appealing designs.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Basics of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><em>Published on October 10, 2024 by Tech School</em></p>
            <img src="techimg/blog2.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence Basics" class="article-image">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword in the tech industry, promising to revolutionize how we interact with technology. But what exactly is AI? At its core, AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.</p>
            <p>Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Technologies like neural networks and deep learning have enabled significant advances in fields such as natural language processing and computer vision.</p>
            <p>The applications of AI are vast, ranging from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis tools. As AI technology continues to evolve, it raises important questions about ethics, data privacy, and the future of work.</p>
